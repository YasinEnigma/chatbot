by : paraparataaa

## Step 1 : Make a bot in Telegram using Bot Father
1. Open Telegram and add @BotFather
2. Start chat and enter `/newbot`
3. Choose a name for our bot
4. Choose a *username* for our bot
5. After the configuration done, copy the HTTP API token that mentioned in BotFather

## Step 2 : Make a tunneling with ngrok
1. Download ngrok from [here](https://ngrok.com/download)
2. Extract ngrok
3. Copy your token from *Auth* menu in our ngrok dashboard 
4. In Linux, add your token to ngrok with :
``` bash
    ./ngrok auth <token>
```
5. We will use **5005** as port for rasa server, so open port 5005 as public with ngrok
``` bash
    ./ngrok http 5005
```
6. Copy https url that generated by ngrok to use later in **credentials.yml** file


## Step 3 : Make Rasa project and connector
1. Make rasa project and train it
2. In **credentials.yml** file, add this code:
``` yml
    telegram:
        access_token: "our_token"
        verify: "our_bot_username"
        webhook_url: "https://<https_ngrok_url_port_5005>/webhooks/telegram/webhook"
```
3. Run rasa project with port 5005 (in default rasa server will run in port 5005)
``` bash
    rasa run
```

## Test
1. Open Telegram and add our bot (@username)
2. Chat with our bot, to test it if it's running well or not
