# Task-003
Develop automatic speech recognition (ASR) for persian language using [NEMO](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) toolkit.

## Working steps:
1. Download and install nemo library.
2. Download dataset of common voice for persian (in here I'm using persian common voice [v.6](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/)).
3. Preprocessing the manifest or text for normalization (remove punctuations, normalize special character like ุณ ุด and etc).
4. Config model that exists in config file (10x5 jusper model used with 4.5 milion paprameters).
5. Number of classes is **48**
6. Train model for 100 epoch using colab.
7. Best result is: **WER = 80%**

# TODO
- [ ] Improve the system accuracy by increase epoch numbers.
- [ ] Using pre-train models and fine-tuning model.
- [ ] More preprocessing.
